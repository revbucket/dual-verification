# dual-verification


# General todos: 
1. Create neural net file that makes it easy to pass Abstract interpretation bounds 
2. Create easy training loops (train mnist neural net in background)
3. Create abstract interpretation classes (hyperbox and zonotopes) 
4. Create methods to do forward passes at each layer 
5. Do easiest possible dual verification stuff 
6. Replicate splitting techniques for lagrangians
